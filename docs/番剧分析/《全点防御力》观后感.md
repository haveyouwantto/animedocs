# 怕痛少女的防御特化：寻找自己的路、展望和谐社区

*2023-04-27*

《因为太怕痛就全点防御力了》是一部让人感到轻松愉悦的番剧。这部番剧建立了一个乌托邦式的游戏社区，让玩家专注于游戏的趣味性，而避免过多关注能力和权力的争夺。这一主题非常符合现实中玩家的期望，带给观众一种强烈的共鸣和期待。

女主角枫是一个非常有趣和另类的角色。她因为怕痛，选择成为一个防御型角色，从而找到了自己的游戏方式。她不走寻常路，经常能找到一般玩家想不到的办法。比如说，她用自己的盾牌当做武器攻击敌人；她用自己的身体吸收毒液来提升防御力；她利用后坐力来实现飞行等等。她善于思考和寻找游戏中的乐趣，也积极帮助其他玩家。同时，枫也是一个非常专注于享受游戏乐趣的人，她不太关心其他人的攀比和竞争。这些特点让枫成为一个个性鲜明和具有魅力的角色。我们可以学习枫的态度，并将这种积极的态度应用于现实生活中，让我们更加专注于我们所做的事情，享受过程中的乐趣。

这部番剧还有一个非常突出的亮点是它塑造了一个乌托邦式的游戏社区。在这个友好的社区中，玩家之间不会因为不同的立场而相互攻击。所有玩家都能够享受游戏带来的乐趣和创造性，并建立积极的互动关系。这种互动关系有助于玩家之间建立信任和友谊，创造出更好的游戏体验。这一设定让人感到非常温暖和舒适。例如，在比赛结束后，玩家们会一起聚会，分享自己的心得和感受，互相赞美和鼓励。这样的场景让人感觉到游戏不仅是一种娱乐，也是一种交流和学习的方式。诚然，这样的游戏社区可能永远不会在现实中出现，但它给人带来了一种希望。它呼唤人们追求友好、和平和共荣，而非利益和斗争。

最后，我们也可以从这部番剧中看出，游戏对于人们来说可以是一种放松和娱乐的方式，它能够让我们从繁忙的日常生活中解脱出来，放松身心。当我们能够正确看待游戏时，它也可以成为一种积极的生活方式。

当然，这部番剧并不完美，其中确实存在一些瑕疵。例如，有的人认为剧情过于平淡，缺乏波折；有的人认为女主角在游戏中实力过于强大，不符合逻辑。但是，这些瑕疵并不能掩盖这部番剧的亮点。它展现了一种积极向上的态度，鼓励人们专注于自己的兴趣爱好，享受游戏的乐趣。它提醒人们应该选择适合自己的方法，而不是盲目追随别人的选择。它还展示了友善、理解、尊重的社区文化，提醒人们在现实生活中也要保持这样的态度。

总的来说，《因为太怕痛就全点防御力了》是一部值得观看的番剧。它或许不会成为一部经典之作，但它能带给观众一种积极向上、充满乐趣和希望的力量，让人重新燃起对生活的热爱和对未来的期待。在这个充满压力和焦虑的世界中，我们需要这样一种力量，让我们重新认识到生活的美好和意义。

"Bofuri: I Don't Want to Get Hurt, so I'll Max Out My Defense" is an anime that brings a sense of lightheartedness and joy to its viewers. It builds a utopian gaming community where players can focus on the fun of the game and avoid power struggles and competition. This theme resonates strongly with players in real life, giving audiences a sense of connection and anticipation.

The protagonist, Kaede, is a unique and interesting character. She chooses to become a defense-oriented player due to her fear of pain, finding her own way of playing the game. Kaede thinks outside the box and often finds ways that other players haven't thought of. For example, she uses her shield as a weapon to attack enemies; she absorbs toxins with her body to enhance her defense; she utilizes recoil to achieve flight, and so on. She enjoys the process of finding the fun in the game and actively helps other players. At the same time, Kaede is very focused on enjoying the game and doesn't care much about the comparison and competition of others. These characteristics make Kaede a charming and charismatic character. We can learn from Kaede's attitude and apply this positivity to our own lives, allowing us to focus on what we are doing and enjoy the process.

One outstanding feature of this anime is its depiction of a utopian gaming community. In this friendly community, players do not attack each other based on different stances. All players can enjoy the creativity and fun of the game, building positive relationships with each other. This type of interaction helps players establish trust and friendship, creating a better gaming experience. This setup brings a warm and comfortable feeling. For example, after the competition, players gather together to share their experiences and feelings, praise and encourage each other. This kind of scene makes people feel that games are not only a form of entertainment but also a way of communication and learning. While this kind of gaming community may never exist in real life, it brings hope to people. It calls on people to pursue friendship, peace, and prosperity rather than benefits and struggles.

Finally, we can also see from this anime that games can be a way for people to relax and entertain themselves, allowing us to escape from the busy and stressful everyday life. When we view games in the correct way, they can also become a positive way of life.

Of course, this anime is not perfect and has some flaws. For example, some people think that the plot is too plain and lacks ups and downs. Some people believe that the protagonist's strength in the game is too strong, which is not logical. However, these flaws cannot conceal the highlights of this anime. It shows a positive and optimistic attitude, encouraging people to focus on their interests and enjoy the fun of the game. It reminds people to choose methods that are suitable for themselves rather than blindly following others' choices. It also demonstrates a culture of friendliness, understanding, and respect, reminding people to maintain such an attitude in real life.

Overall, "Bofuri" is an anime worth watching. It may not become a classic work, but it can bring a positive, fun, and hopeful energy to the audience, reigniting their love for life and expectations for the future. In this world full of pressure and anxiety, we need this kind of energy to help us rediscover the beauty and meaning of life.
